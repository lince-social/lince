# General Functioning

## Table: record

| record   |
| ---------|
| id       |
| quantity |
| head     |
| body     |
| location |

Lince is centered on the 'record' table, but like, according to the creator... like, what do they know?

Let's assume this is Lince's sun, it is the most capable one on the task of giving Lince life. The thing the app revolves around.

---

| record   | DATA STRUCTURE          |
| ---------| ------------------------|
| id       | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY      |
| quantity | REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 |
| head     | TEXT                    |
| body     | TEXT                    |
| location | POINT                   |

'id's are automatically generated.

'quantity' represents the availability of the record, if negative it is a Necessity, if positive, a Contribution, zero makes it not mean much, sometimes.

'head' and 'body' are meant to be parts of a whole, where one can be used for a short summary and the other a description, or one has all the information and the other holds tags for filtering through views. With a pubsub protocol, one can send a short information of the record, in this case it can be the head, and put the rest in the body. Only those interested in the head will ask for the body of the record. That way the minimum amount of information is sent over the network, making it faster and stuff, I think.

'location' is an important information for interactions outside of computers (they exist, it's insane) or any other use you want to give it.

---

| record   | DATA STRUCTURE          | USER INPUT |
-----------|-------------------------|------------|
| id       | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY      |            |
| quantity | REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 | -1         |
| head     | TEXT                    | Eat Apple  |
| body     | TEXT                    |            |
| location | POINT                   |            |

So for an example imagine that you like apples and you want to create a task to eat it today.

You create a 'record', giving it '-1' to the 'quantity', for that action is a Necessity in your life right now, and 'Eat Apple' to the 'head'.

---

| record   | DATA STRUCTURE          | USER INPUT | ACTUAL RECORD |
| ---------| ------------------------| -----------| --------------|
| id       | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY      |            | 1             |
| quantity | REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 | -1         | -1            |
| head     | TEXT                    | Eat Apple  | Eat Apple     |
| body     | TEXT                    |            | NULL          |
| location | POINT                   |            | NULL          |

The end result, on the PostgreSQL database, is this record. In summary, fields with 'NOT NULL' that have defaults don't need to be filled, as it happens automatically.

---

| id  | quantity | head      | body | location |
|-----|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| 1   | -1       | Eat Apple | NULL | NULL     |
|     |          |           |      |          |
|     |          |           |      |          |
|     |          |           |      |          |
|     |          |           |      |          |

The theoretical apple eater in the example chose to put -1 in 'quantity' because they have a view that gives them all the records with a negative 'quantity' (quantity < 0).

So they will see the 'Eat Apple' task on that view, but more about that in a second, now look at other examples of records (rows are set horizontally now).

---

| id  | quantity | head        | body                 | location |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| 1   | -1       | Eat Apple   | NULL                 | NULL     |
| 2   | 1        | Apple       | Item, Food           | NULL     |
| 3   | 0        | Brush Teeth | Action, Hygiene      | NULL     |
| 4   | 3        | Toothbrush  | Item, Hygiene        | NULL     |
| 5   | -1       | Meditate    | Action, Spirituality | NULL     |

As you can see, there are records with different quantities, heads, and bodies. They are modeling actions and items.

The user likes to center it's filtering through the body column, seeing all actions, or all items of a certain area of their lives, like Hygiene, each in different created views.

## Table: views

| views     | DATA STRUCTURE                                    |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| id        | id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY                             |
| view      | view TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'SELECT * FROM record' |
| view_name | view_name TEXT                                    |

We've spoken so much about views, let's dive into them. They are essentially SQL queries, allowing you to select what columns you want to see, filtered, ordered and much more, just the way you want it.

Tool for Registry, Interconnection, and Automation of Needs and Contributions
Introduction

What is Lince?
Lince is a versatile tool designed to model, track, and automate interactions between Needs and Contributions. Whether you're managing personal tasks, trading goods, or automating digital workflows, Lince offers flexibility to tailor it to your needs.

Think of it as a universal registry where everything is a "record," and you decide how to connect and utilize them.

General Functioning
The Record Table

Lince is centered around the record table, which acts as the core component of the system. Think of it as the "sun" in Lince’s universe, around which everything revolves.
Structure:
Column	Data Type	Description
id	SERIAL PRIMARY KEY	Unique identifier for each record.
quantity	REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1	Represents availability: positive for Contributions, negative for Needs.
head	TEXT	A short summary or title of the record.
body	TEXT	A more detailed description or tags for filtering records.
location	POINT	Geographical location related to the record (if applicable).
