Lince: Tool for registry, interconnection and automation of anything.
=====================================================================

# Usage:
Have Nix installed, possibly through:
https://nixos.org/download

Then, after cloning the repo, to run Lince, just enter it and type:
nix-shell

# Disclamer
This is a non-profit FOSS project. Crowd funding is the source of development compensation: [apoia.se/lince](https://www.apoia.se/lince), [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lince-social) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lince_social). The tasks are on the app at the main branch, to get a more stable version with a clean db check the releases/tags.

It is important to highlight that Lince is responsible for facilitating the connection between people and resources, transforming needs and contributions into data. The gains and losses related to the interaction, such as transportation, production and services themselves, remain the responsibility of the parties involved.

# About
Lince models anything and everything with a Quantity, if it is below zero, it is a Need (N), if higher than zero, it is a Contribution (C). After the modeling is complete, it is possible to change the Quantity, be it through human trades or donations. Alternativelly the user can also automate it, with the app's several functionalities, to get the most value out of the technology. Below are a few examples of what can be modeled:

## Needs:
- Basic and personal, such as: water, electricity, sanitation, health, education, housing, food, clothing, habits, nature, community, etc.
- Services, such as: transportation, technical support, nursing, gardening, culture, entertainment, tourism, automation, etc.
- Other consumer goods, such as: appliances, work tools, internet, computing, machinery and raw materials, etc.

## Contributions:
- Products.
- Services, including: classes, technical support, installations, development, consulting, etc.
- Social assistance, community work, donation items, etc.
- Information, infrastructure, financing, presence, etc.

Today many apps are developed with a specific segment of human interaction in mind. This project's goal is to allow any type of human interaction to exist without an extra need of app development. Many hours of human work are saved with the technological development concentrated in a single system. Such concentration is possible with the flexibility and decentralization of the application.

The vision is a descentralized network of nodes that carry eventually consistent databases, possibly Merkle-CRDTs, with pub/sub protocols for minimum network usage.
