Lince is tries to facilitate and automate the connection between people and resources, transforming needs and contributions into data. The gains and losses related to the interaction, such as transportation, production and services themselves, remain the responsibility of the parties involved.

# About
Lince models anything and everything with a Quantity, for it to be changed manually, through human interactions or automatically, joining several building blocks to create precise changes to that Quantity or activation of scripts. Below are a few examples of what can be modeled:

## Needs:
- Basic and personal, such as: water, electricity, sanitation, health, education, housing, food, clothing, habits, nature, community, etc.
- Services, such as: transportation, technical support, nursing, gardening, culture, entertainment, tourism, automation, etc.
- Other consumer goods, such as: appliances, work tools, internet, computing, machinery and raw materials, etc.

## Contributions:
- Products of any kind.
- Services, including: classes, technical support, installations, development, consulting, etc.
- Social assistance, community work, donation items, etc.
- Information, infrastructure, financing, presence, etc.

The goal is an app that can be implemented in most devices, with each implementation being a node on a descentralized network, communicating through pub/sub protocols, storing data in eventually consistent databases, orienting the system with Merkle-CRDTs.
