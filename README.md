# Lince
Tool for registry, interconnection and automation of Needs and Contributions with open scope.

Detailed explanations of what Lince is, how to run it and use it's ecosystem can be found in the [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lince-social/lince/main/documentation/main.pdf).

To install, you can download the crate and run it:
```bash
# Download
cargo install lince

# Run
lince
```

Or get the binary [here](https://github.com/lince-social/lince/tags). Pick the latest one for your machine and operating system, then unzip and execute the binary:

```bash
./lince
```

If you want to compile it, and have [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed, run:

```bash
cargo run
```

Both methods should allow you to start using it at [http://localhost:6174](http://localhost:6174). I recommend using Lince as a linux service. Have fun.
