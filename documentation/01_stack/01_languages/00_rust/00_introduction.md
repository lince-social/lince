# Rust
Rust is a Procedural, Compiled, Borrow Checked (Memory Safe(r)), Statically Typed, Lower Level Than Go And Higher Level Than C programming language. It offers great concurrency, async (hard) and robust unwanted behavior elimination. Has a powerful standard library but shines greatly with crates (dependencies), using cargo, it's package management system.

There are many ways to write procedures like any language. Some more idiomatic than others, with one liners, syntax sugar and macros. This manual serves as a way of helping to write good Rust procedures, outside of executing Clippy's suggestions (more info below).

You install Rust preferably through [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), which comes with the whole toolchain (you are going to need it), including:
- rustc: the Rust compiler.
- [cargo](https://crates.io/): the package manager and build tool.
- rustfmt: formats Rust code according to style guidelines.
- [clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/index.html): a linter that provides suggestions to improve your code (micro best practices).
- rust-analyzer: a language server for IDE support and code navigation.
