# Frequency

| frequency    | DATA TYPE |
| ------------ | --------- |
| id           | INTEGER   |
| quantity     | INTEGER   |
| day_week     | INTEGER   |
| months       | INTEGER   |
| days         | INTEGER   |
| seconds      | INTEGER   |
| next_date    | STRING |
| finish_date  | STRING |
| catch_up_sum | INTEGER   |

The frequency table holds account of a fixed period for returning a value of 1 or more. If a frequency occurs every 1 day and 60 seconds it might start, for example at 2030-01-01 10:00:00. When that time comes, if this Frequency exists in a Karma Condition it will be checked and updated, setting next_date to 2030-01-02 10:01:00.

The catch_up_sum is a multiplier, if many days have passed since the last check like 4, instead of each minute it returns one, if catch up sum is 1 it will in the same Deliver jump the next_date until it has surpassed the current time returning the amount of times. Anything else will not do that.

In Karma, Frequencies are represented by the letter 'f'. So setting in a Condition '-1 * f1' means Karma Delivery will check the returned number for the specific Frequency with Id 1 and multiply that by '-1'.
