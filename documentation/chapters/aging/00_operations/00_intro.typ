== Operations

You can type operations to perform actions anywhere in Lince. An input bar will show up, allowing for combinations of commands.

If you type '4c' a modal for creating a Record will pop up. Typing 'a' with a number, like 'a2' will make Configuration with id 2 be active, and others inactive, an easy way to change colorscheme. One handy one is 's' with a number, 's1' to run a command.

Just typing a number, like '23' will make the Record with id 23 have it's quantity become zero.
