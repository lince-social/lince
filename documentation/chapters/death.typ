Like every good contribution, the goal is to not have to contribute anymore; because it was a one time need,
or the frequent need has been solved. Lince is a contribution to the need of having Lince.
The death of Lince is the death of the need of Lince. If there is ever any configuration of resources that makes Lince useless,
then it's job is fullfilled, there is nothing else to be done, no commit, no push, just vibes.
