In Brazil there is a model of legal organization called Associação privada with a non-profit declaration.
It has the best legal model for Lince in the several years to come. It's main purpose is to be a legal body
in case the project needs to be represented or have a relationship with other parties.
These relationships include donations, contracts with developers, legal operational reports and more.

The legal category of the organization is an 'Associação privada'. The plan is for the public legal names 'Razão Social' and 'Nome Fantasia'
to be 'Insituto Lince'. And to be commonly known when reffering to the project as Lince and have the institute as a supporting piece.

The following documents explain all the papers needed for the entire lifecycle of the Instituto Lince, the legal
entity in Brazil to operate and represent the bureaucracy of the project.

*Ata de Fundação*
Document used to officially create the organization, needs at minimum the founder Eduardo another associate (they dont need to be
involved in the project after the creation).

*Estatuto Social*
The rules and permissions the project has. The rights and duties it proposes to follow.

*Procuração*
Document to be updated and adapted whenever a new legal/financial task needs to be complete, and it's not done by the Executive Director.
