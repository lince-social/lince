== Modules

Inspired by the Emacs philosophy of being very complete with packages and modes, Lince is an app that tries to do everything. But everything is a lot. So to help specialize and minimize compile times and complexity a system of modules/plugins needs to exist.

The current state of things is to put everything inside the binary, because I am a noob. Next are some features that should probably be modules/plugins but are just there.
