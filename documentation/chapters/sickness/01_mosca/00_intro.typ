== Mosca

M.O.S.C.A: Management of Operating Systems, Configuring Automatically. A great acronym, not just because I like to give animal names to my creations.

Mosca is to be the Rust code that will execute highly specific operations, running away from the philosophy of the core of Lince, which is generic. An example is Anicca, which mimics [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)'s awesome [Impermanence](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Impermanence): factory reset of system, safe for some specified directories and files.
