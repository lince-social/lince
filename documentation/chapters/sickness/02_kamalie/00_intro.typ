== Kamalie

Kamalie - The lie of desire.

Be able to use Lince's tables as the data to run the game, a different dna can be inputted, which is the dna of the game, using record with a quantity, body for darmas, i dunno.
There could be a mode that wasnt classic kamalie, but entered a kamalie state/world with normal day to day lince data, being able to see the voxel world with normal data. that doesnt interact the same way classic kamalie does, being able to see in a different visual the application of a karma to a record with a frequency, if it will balloon in size.
