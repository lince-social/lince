This chapter explains Lince's components in more detail. It is the worse chapter by far. The project is too much in an Alpha stage
and the Schema of the Database changes too much and a definitive one hasn't been chosen (was Postgres at first, now it's SQLite).
Some of the properties in here might be out of date or not implemented yet.
Explanation of the tables _should_ be mostly focused on the ideas, the solutions brought to a problem yet to be found.
