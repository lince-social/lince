Most software is repetitive Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations. They exist as islands on the big internet sea. Lince tries to build a Pangea.

We can create a good general base for basic CRUD software, and continue to expand beyond that. The diversity in what can be created with it is the real power.

People will have access to a free and open source todo app, event planner, financial analysis platform, industrial production planning and more; all with a change of data (DNA) and maybe some extensions.

Once the operational part of life is modeled, automated and interconnected,
the effects of having built a robust and generic base for interaction with systems will start to show. If there is no incentive to rebuild
a management system/platform (because there is a clearly G.O.A.T.ed one), more efforts will have to be focused on new highly specific
innovative and optmizing ideas. People will enjoy having previously centralized, private and paywalled capabilities now in close reach for free.

Think of Amazon and Uber, they are companies that get a cut, to orchestrate
something that computationally a global peer-to-peer network personal devices could easily manage. Think of how much your much time your devices
spend processing your online purchases and how much it could be plugged into the LNHM (Lince-Net-Hive-Mind).

Amazon is a platform for Records of item contributions, your purchases are Transfer Proposals. The rides you make
on Uber are Transfer Proposals of money for transportation from point A to B. Any automation they make inside their platforms is
limited to the data they have on you, which is a miniscule amount of your whole life (at least I hope it is). If you where to
set up hacky ways to use those platforms automatically to fit your needs, you would be doing it to every app you have, connecting them in ways they
where not meant to, possibly programming something to organize all those changing external apps. It doesn't need to be that inefficient,
you can have one central program that you can trust to work offline for you, acting just the way you want, featureful, built by many people,
for it is the main one. The model of Lince can be a superset of many apps, and can spark many different markets and support people with it's usage.

Lince is actually not the app you install, that's a Lince Cell. When you have a group of Cells (or p2p nodes) you have
a Lince Organ; people interacting to meed their needs (or others'). Lince is actually when all Cells and Organs work together to satiate everyone's Needs.
It's only a complete animal when independent of platform, language, nationality
[TODO: insert the rest of 'imagine all the people' by john lenon's lyrics here]... or footbal team,  people are working together like the image below:

    tiger careful it might bite],
)

The assumption is that an app that is useful for a lot of cases and incentivizes people to help eachother, with no extra friction, is the best use of technology we can have. It will not solve anything by itself, but is is the best tool in the software part of the world.

== Serious Mode
Like every good contribution, the goal is to not have to contribute anymore; because it was a one time need, or the frequent need has been solved.

Lince is a contribution to the need of having Lince, of having all production
possibly connected, so there is predictability in resource usage and logistics coordination.

It's a contribution to the disorganized construction of solutions glued by the internet, centralized in platforms that worsen by the day.

It's a contribution to understanding the whole of possibilities of how you can connect with other people,
after seeing needs you didnt know others had, sparking ideas of contributions you didn't know you could make.

The death of Lince is the death of the need of Lince. If there is ever any configuration of resources that makes Lince useless,
then it's job is fullfilled, there is nothing else to be done, no commit, no push, just vibes. Untill then, a system for self organization
that can turn into a dance of the world is, to some, something useful and exciting to build.

A team is being assembled, to fight the battle of killing Lince. Will you join the cult?
