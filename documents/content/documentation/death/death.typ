== Let's Dream A Little
The quote of "The Mummy (1999): Death is only the beginning" makes total sense with the following performative explanations on The Death of Lince.
Building subsets of the perfect functionality
of this app is repetitive and makes most Software Engineering a bullshit job if the vision is correct (already is even if it's wrong).

Once the operational part of life is modeled, automated and interconnected,
the effects of having built a robust and generic base for interaction with systems will start to show. If there is no incentive to rebuild
a management system/platform (because there is a clearly G.O.A.T.ed one), more efforts will have to be focused on new highly specific
innovative and optmizing ideas. People will enjoy having previously centralized, private and paywalled capabilities in the palm of their hands
or in the chips of their brains if you are into that stuff. If apps are islands and people are like jet-skis then the current landscape is like
an archipelago, Lince aims to create a Pangea.

Think of Amazon and Uber, they are companies that get a cut, to orchestrate
something that computationally a global peer-to-peer network personal devices could easily manage. Think of how much your much time your devices
spend processing your online purchases and how much it could be plugged into the LNHM (Lince-Net-Hive-Mind).

Amazon is a platform for Records of item contributions, your purchases are Transfer Proposals. The rides you make
on Uber are Transfer Proposals of money for transportation from point A to B. Any automation they make inside their platforms is
limited to the data they have on you, which is a miniscule amount of your whole life (at least I hope it is). If you where to
set up hacky ways to use those platforms automatically to fit your needs, you would be doing it to every app you have, connecting them in ways they
where not meant to, possibly programming something to organize all those changing external apps. It doesn't need to be that inefficient,
you can have one central program that you can trust to work offline for you, acting just the way you want, featureful, built by many people,
for it is the main one. The model of Lince can be a superset of many apps, and can spark many different markets and support people with it's usage.

Lince is actually not the app you install, that's a Lince Cell. When you have a group of Cells (or p2p nodes) you have
a Lince Organ; people interacting to meed their needs (or others'). Lince is actually when all Cells and Organs work together.
It's only a complete animal when independent of platform, language, nationality
[TODO: insert the rest of 'imagine all the people' by john lenon's lyrics here]... or footbal team,  people are working together like the image below:

== Serious Mode
Like every good contribution, the goal is to not have to contribute anymore; because it was a one time need, or the frequent need has been solved.

Lince is a contribution to the need of having Lince, of having all production
possibly connected, so there is predictability in resource usage and logistics coordination.

It's a contribution to the disorganized construction of solutions glued by the internet, centralized in platforms that worsen by the day.

It's a contribution to understanding the whole of possibilities of how you can connect with other people,
after seeing needs you didnt know others had, sparking ideas of contributions you didn't know you could make.

The death of Lince is the death of the need of Lince. If there is ever any configuration of resources that makes Lince useless,
then it's job is fullfilled, there is nothing else to be done, no commit, no push, just vibes. Untill then, a system for self organization
that can turn into a dance of the world is to the writer something useful and exciting to build.

A team is being assembled, to fight the battle of killing Lince. Will you join the cult?

== Why Lince?
Here is a list how Lince might help the needs of different people to emotionally manipulate you into helping build it, feel free to add yours for
the piramid scheme:

-- *Eduardo de Melo Xavier*: I want Lince to be productive and help others with basic needs. After that I want to register resources to meditate.
